# NAME
#      tmdns.services - Service configuration file for tmdns
#
# SYNOPSIS
#      The  tmdns.services file is used to specify which services
#      tmdns, should announce via mDNS.
#
#      Multicast DNS clients may use  service  (SRV)  records  to
#      locate  services,  such as printers, within the local sub-
#      net.
#
# FILE FORMAT
#      Lines starting  with  a  "#"  are  comments  and  will  be
#      ignored.   Any  number  of white spaces are taken as field
#      separators  and  ignored  otherwise, with the exception of 
#      the last field, where whitspace is preserved.
#
#      Each  non-empty  line defines a service entry to be adver-
#      tised by mDNS and should be made  up  from  the  following
#      fields:
#
#      proto  The  IP  protocol to advertise, either tcp, udp or
#             text.
#
#             A value of text signifies a text record that should
#             be associated with the previous service record. The
#             remainder of the line is regarded as a string to be
#             put  into  the text record.  Consecutive text lines
#             are gathered into a single TXT record.
#
#      For any other protocol than text the remainder of the line
#      is interpreted as a the following fields
#
#      port   The tcp or udp port number to advertise.
#
#      priority
#             A  priority  for  this entry. Clients should select
#             the service with the lowest priority value  on  the
#             network.
#
#      weight Clients  should prefer the highest weighted service
#             record they get.
#
#      name   A name given to this service.  This  field  may  be
#             left empty, in which case the service is advertised
#             as <host>._<service>._<proto>.local, otherwise the
#             service   will   be   advertised  as 
#             <name>._<service>._proto.local.  In  both  cases  a 
#             pointer  record  is  advertised   under   the  name
#             _<service>._<proto>.local  to allow clients to find
#             all  services  of  a specific type within the local
#             network.
#
#      All strings in text lines and  the  content  of  the  name
#      field  must  be  encoded  as UTF8 when you wish to include
#      non-ascii characters. Dots,  spaces  and  backslashes  are
#      escaped  as needed. The name may not exceed 63 characters,
#      escaped characters count as two chars.
#
#      You may use the iconv utility to en- and decode  the  name
#      fields to and from your local charset.
