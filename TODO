o implement SRV records + some tools to update published services.
  (done for static/semi-static case via files. Could be done better)
  Idea:
    Implement DNS update behaviour as close as possible. 
    + clients using this method automatically can update unicast DNS
      servers.
    + No new protocol needed. DNS record parsing is implemented anyway,
      just need the logic to do this.
    - people begining to adapt the mdnsd interface.

o Better Browsing support
  Idea:
    a) Implement TCP support (strictly speaking, needed anyway)
    b) Client sends dns query via tcp.
    c) first answer packet is handled as usual, i.e. gather responses,
       send one response after gather_delay seconds.
    d) send more answers as long as the tcp connection is alive.

o use multiple packets when probing/announcing, not just one jumbo packet.
  (implemented but needs more work and testing)

o check compatibility with other implementations, notably Rendevouz.
  (Got a Mac now, so I got something to test against.
   Probing won't nuke your Mac from the namespace anymore. Does not 
   implement tie break however and does not fall-back into probing mode.)

o add packaging stuff. Help !
  (Got a spec file from Steve Grubb. Deb ? Gentoo ? )

o man page
  (needs proof-reading to fix my bad english)
